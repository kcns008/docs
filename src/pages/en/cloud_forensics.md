When the culprit doesn't readily reveal itself during observation, you can choose to record traffic based on a schedule or the occurrence of specific events or behaviors.
Traffic is recorded in PCAP format and uploaded to immutable file storage. PCAP files can be retained for extended periods and analyzed offline at the viewer's discretion.

You can record traffic based on specific patterns and make this recorded traffic available for offline analysis.
